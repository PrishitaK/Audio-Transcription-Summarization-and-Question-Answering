# Audio-Transcription-Summarization-and-Question-Answering

## Project Summary
The project is aimed at building an application capable of scraping the web for podcast audios and performing transcription of these audio files and summarizing them. The application harnesses the power of Vosk and LangChain to generate transcriptions which can be then referenced for answering user questions. 

## Technologies Used
1. **VOSK** - Vosk is an offline open source speech recognition toolkit enabling speech recognition for 20+ languages and dialects.
2. **LangChain** - LangChain enables us to create applications using large language models.
3. **FAISS** - Faiss vector store is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
